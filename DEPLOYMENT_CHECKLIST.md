# Wahkip MVP Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment: Environment Variables

### Vercel Environment Variables Setup

Go to your Vercel project settings → Environment Variables and add:

#### Required Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your-service-role-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

**Important:** Replace `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` with your actual Vercel deployment URL after first deploy.

#### Optional Variables (for AI features)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

#### Feature Flags
```
FEATURE_HELPERS=true
FEATURE_REALTIME=true
DEMO_MODE=true
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Initial Deploy
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Deploy to Vercel (Preview)
vercel

# After first deploy, update NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL in Vercel settings
# Then deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Post-Deployment Verification

Run these smoke tests to verify everything works:

#### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health
```
**Expected:** `{"ok":{"url":true,"anon":true,"service":true},"service":"wahkip"}`

#### Events API
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/events?city=Kingston
```
**Expected:** `{"items":[...],"page":1,"total":N}` (200 status)

#### Itinerary Generation
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/ai/itinerary \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"city":"Kingston","date":"2024-01-15","interests":["music","food"]}'
```
**Expected:** `{"itinerary":{...},"picks":[...],"itinerary_id":"..."}`

#### Helpers Search
```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/helpers/search?city=Kingston
```
**Expected:** `{"items":[...],"suggestedPriceRange":{"min":N,"max":N}}`

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Homepage (/) 
- [ ] Page loads without 500 errors
- [ ] Error banner shows if events API fails (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Generate Itinerary form works
- [ ] Three horizontal event rows display:
  - [ ] Music in Kingston
  - [ ] Food & Markets
  - [ ] Culture & Wellness
- [ ] Event cards scroll horizontally
- [ ] Realtime badge appears when new events are inserted

### Itinerary Generation
- [ ] Form accepts city, date, interests
- [ ] Generates itinerary (AI or fallback)
- [ ] "View & Share Itinerary" link appears
- [ ] Link navigates to `/itinerary/[id]`
- [ ] Share button copies URL to clipboard
- [ ] Itinerary timeline displays correctly

### Helpers Directory (/helpers)
- [ ] Lists verified helpers
- [ ] Shows suggested price range
- [ ] Displays helper details (name, city, skills, rates)
- [ ] Phone and WhatsApp links work
- [ ] Empty state shows "No helpers yet" when no data

### Helper Registration (/helpers/register)
- [ ] Form accepts all fields
- [ ] Validates required fields (name, city)
- [ ] Submits successfully
- [ ] Shows success message
- [ ] Redirects to /helpers after 2 seconds

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current MVP Scope
- ✅ Production stability (no 500s, graceful degradation)
- ✅ Explore layer with tag-based rows
- ✅ Itinerary generation with AI fallback
- ✅ Shareable itinerary links
- ✅ Helpers directory with search
- ✅ Helper registration (unverified by default)
- ✅ Realtime event notifications

### Not Included (Future Enhancements)
- ❌ User authentication (helpers use service role for now)
- ❌ Payments integration
- ❌ Map clustering
- ❌ Full moderation system
- ❌ Helper availability realtime presence (basic structure exists)
- ❌ Advanced filtering UI

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel
- Check that `next.config.mjs` has `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` and `ignoreBuildErrors: true`
- Verify all TypeScript errors are non-blocking
- Check build logs for specific errors

### SSR Fetch Fails (ECONNREFUSED)
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set to your Vercel deployment URL
- Check that the URL doesn't have trailing slash
- Ensure API routes are accessible at `/api/*`

### Events API Returns Empty
- Verify Supabase connection in `/api/health`
- Check RLS policies allow public read on events table
- Verify events exist in database with correct city/tags

### Itinerary Generation Fails
- Check AI API keys are set (or fallback will be used)
- Verify `itinerary_requests` and `itineraries` tables exist
- Check service role key has write permissions

### Helpers Not Showing
- Verify helpers are marked as `verified: true` in database
- Check RLS policies allow public read on helpers table
- Ensure city filter matches helper records

## Database Setup

Ensure these tables exist (from `supabase/migrations/001_base.sql`):
- `events` - with RLS policy for public read
- `venues` - with RLS policy for public read
- `helpers` - with RLS policy for public read
- `helper_availability` - with RLS policy for public read
- `itinerary_requests` - with RLS policy for public read
- `itineraries` - with RLS policy for public read
- `reviews` - with RLS policy for public read
- `metrics` - for observability

## Performance Notes

- Homepage uses ISR with 60s revalidation
- Helper directory uses ISR with 30s revalidation
- API routes use Edge runtime for low latency
- Itinerary generation uses Node runtime with 20s timeout
- All API routes return 200 status even on errors (graceful degradation)

## Monitoring

Check these endpoints periodically:
- `/api/health` - Environment variable status
- Vercel Analytics - Page load times and errors
- Supabase Dashboard - Database query performance
